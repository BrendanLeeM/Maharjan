READ ME: 
My program can be compiled by calling "make" (without quotes). 
The executable will be myShell, can be ran by typing "./myShell" (without quotes). 
Make clean can be called to clean up .o files. 

Other things to note: 
There is no time in the files in linux for us to exec, so I display time using "date +%T"
There is no help in the files for us to exec, so I simply call "man man" which displays a users manual.
